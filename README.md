# Topics in Scientific Computing Coursework

## Description

This is a repository to store my attempt at the Scientific Computing coursework as part of the MSc Mathematics programme at QMUL. The broad goal of the project is to write code to model coplanar stellar systems (i.e., all the motion is in the x and y directions) with up to three stars. 

## Contents

This project contains two documents:

- `Marksheet_230793835.pdf` A PDF document that contains the marks awarded for the coursework on the trinary star system.
- `Computing Coursework 230793835.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook with my answers to the coursework. In this document, you will find markdown text around each block of code which gives context to the answers given.
